# Debugging Lab

Rules for this lab: You can use google or each other as resources. You cannot ask Instructors or TAs for help. The point of this lab is to help learn how to debug things on your own and start to recognize familiar errors.

Iâ€™ll release an answer guide to all the bugs next week for you to compare against.

## Common issues to look out for:
Misspellngs  
- Syntax errors  
- Forgot to run a command  
- Forgot to include or export a needed resource  

The goal is to take the code provided and fix it so that you get a UI to show up and have no errors in the developer tools console.

And remember, when in doubt, console.log it out!!


Bonus: Restructure this to use MVC architecture
